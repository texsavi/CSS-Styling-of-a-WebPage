The link to the style page was missing.

Solution 1 is to insert the link.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>replit</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>
```

Solution 2 is to have a `style` tag in the head of the html page that contains all the css needed.  This isn't ideal though, because then you can't share your CSS across multiple pages.
